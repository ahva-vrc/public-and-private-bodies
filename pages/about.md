This course explores changing roles for visual art and culture within communes, courts, religious practices and private lives in Renaissance Italy. New patrons and uses for artworks prompted a wealth of artistic activity that defined and shaped contemporary values, ideas, perceptions, beliefs, and identities. For example, bankers, merchants, and mercenaries exploited the power of art and architecture to forge and to buttress their public image and family name. Religious institutions and commercial guilds similarly propagated their claims through visual imagery. Furthermore, gender, sexuality and space provided the frameworks through which power and legitimacy were both staged and contested during a pivotal century that was shaped by the printing press, the discovery of worlds previously unknown to Europeans, the invasion of Italy by foreigners, the Reformation and Counter- Reformation, and the rising status of the artist.
